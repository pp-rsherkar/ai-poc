  Scenario Outline: Validate that a line item cannot be saved without valid flight details and appropriate budget and date constraints
    And User clicks on Create Campaign
    When User enters the campaign details as "01- Advertiser" "Auto" "Regular" "20000" and saves the campaign
    Then Verify campaign details are saved and user is navigated to the line item page
    And Verify Line Item page has below tabs
      | Overview       |
      | Details        |
      | Flights        |
      | Conversion     |

      | Media Insights |
    And Verify status of line item is Incomplete when there are no tactics under the line item
    When User fills in required details "<LINE_ITEM>" except for flight information and save
    Then User should see an error message to add flight details
    And User clicks Add Flight button
    And User tries to save the line item without entering any flight details
    Then User should see error message "Invalid budget" when tries to save line item page
    And Verify if user enters flight budget that exceeds Campaign budget
    Then User should see error message when tries to save line item page
    And User adds the flight details - Flight Start Date, Flight End Date, "<BUDGET>"
    And User adds new flight and enter overlapping flight details - Flight Start Date, Flight End Date, "<BUDGET>"
    And User should see error message when tries to save line item page and dates fields should get highlighted with inline error message
    And Verify "Apply Impression Cap for This Flight" and "Apply Daily Impression Cap" checkboxes are available for each flight entry
    And User should be able to check the "Apply Impression Cap for This Flight" and "Apply Daily Impression Cap" checkboxes

  @todo
  Scenario: Percentage-budgeted tactics show a read-only dollar value next to the percentage, computed against the current or upcoming flight's budget
    Given a Line Item's Allocation setting is Percentage
    When User views the Tactic Allocation field
    Then a read-only dollar value displays next to the percentage
    And the Tactic table at the line item level shows the same read-only dollar value next to each tactic's percentage
    And the Tactic sidebar shows the combined format, for example "Budget: 50% ($50.00)"
    Given a current flight exists for the line item
    Then the dollar value is computed against the current flight's budget
    Given no current flight exists but an upcoming flight exists
    Then the dollar value is computed against the upcoming flight's budget
    Given neither a current nor a future flight exists
    Then no dollar value is shown, only the percentage
    Given a flight's budget changes after a percentage is already set
    Then the displayed dollar value recalculates against the new budget rather than showing a stale amount
    Given percentage allocations across tactics do not sum to 100%
    Then each tactic's dollar value is still computed independently and correctly per its own percentage
    Given a line item is switched from Percentage back to Dollar budgeting and back to Percentage again
    Then the computed dollar value redisplays correctly rather than retaining a stale cached figure
