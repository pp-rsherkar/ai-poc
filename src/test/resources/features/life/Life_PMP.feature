    Given The same deal is opened via "Supply > Deals" and via "Media Planner > Deals", both set to "Last 7 Days"
    Then Display Inventory and Video Inventory figures match exactly across both surfaces
  # Framework Gap: Requires Timeframe-scope-across-views read hook in LifeSteps.java
    When User sets Timeframe to "Last 30 Days" then switches between Display Inventory and Video Inventory
    Then Document whether Timeframe persists across the switch or resets per view, since AMB-3 leaves this unspecified
  # Framework Gap: Requires mixed-creative-type deal fixture and category-read hook in LifeSteps.java
    When User views a deal with both a video creative and a static creative in inventory
    Then Document how each item is categorized, since AMB-2 leaves the Display/Video boundary unspecified

    # Framework Gap: Requires a before/after Media Planner behavior comparison hook in LifeSteps.java
    Given The Media Planner deals view is used as it was before this release
    Then Its existing behaviour is unaffected by the added Inventory Breakdown control
    # Framework Gap: Requires a deal-label regression check across the deal screens
    And Deal detail labels and figures elsewhere on the deal screens remain correct after the breakdown is added
    # Framework Gap: Requires a no-deals-applied fixture and a curated-market/PMP-attribution read hook

    # Framework Gap: Requires an avails-history fixture (deal with no avails yesterday / past 7 days) and a tactic-level warning indicator page object
    Given A tactic directly targets an active deal
    When That deal had no avails yesterday
    Then A warning appears at tactic level and states that the 1-day window triggered
    When That deal has had no avails for the whole 7-day period including yesterday

    # Framework Gap: Requires an all-unavailable fixture, both for a multi-deal group and for a tactic targeting exactly one deal
    Given Every deal applied to a tactic is unavailable
    Then An orange box warning appears
    And Both the per-deal warning and the all-unavailable orange box appear together where the design requires it

  # Source: ET-25054
  @todo
  Scenario: The no-avails warning appears under both inventory targeting modes
    Given A tactic's inventory targeting is set to Selected Inventory Only
    Then The no-avails warning is surfaced when applicable
    Given A tactic's inventory targeting is Selected Inventory plus Open Exchange
    Then The no-avails warning is surfaced when applicable

  # Source: ET-25054
  @todo
  Scenario: A tactic showing a no-avails warning can still be saved and activated, and the warning clears once avails resume
    Given A tactic shows a no-avails warning
    Then The tactic can still be saved and can still be activated
    Given Every deal on a tactic is unavailable
    Then The tactic can still be saved and activated
    When A flagged deal starts recording avails again
    Then Its warning disappears, while a warning on another deal in the same group remains until that deal also recovers
    When A flagged deal is removed from the tactic
    Then The warning updates accordingly

  # Source: ET-25054
  @todo
  Scenario: No-avails warnings coexist with the existing curated market indicator, and a data-lookup failure does not flag every deal
    # Framework Gap: Requires the existing curated-market-incompatibility indicator located and confirmed in the codebase before a coexistence assertion can be written
    Given A deal group carries both a no-avails warning and the existing curated markets incompatibility indicator
    Then Both render correctly and neither suppresses the other
    # Framework Gap: Requires an avails-data-retrieval-failure fixture
    When The avails data retrieval fails
    Then Every applied deal is not automatically flagged as a false positive
    # Framework Gap: Requires a mixed active/inactive deal-group fixture, and a fixture combining a direct deal with a deal group on the same tactic
    Given A deal group holds both an inactive deal with no avails and an active deal with no avails
    Then The warning reflects only the active, eligible deal
    Given A tactic targets both a direct deal and a deal group
    Then Flagged deals from both are surfaced
    # Framework Gap: Requires a hidden/inaccessible-deal fixture, consistent with the unshared-deal handling in ET-25077
    Given A hidden or inaccessible deal is applied to a tactic
    Then No false no-avails warning appears for it beyond what the unshared-deal handling already covers
    And No false no-avails warning appears on a tactic whose deals all have healthy avails

  Scenario Outline: The no-avails warning in the "<SECTION>" section states the count of flagged deals
    When User clicks Tactic Setting tab
    Then User should navigate to respective Tactic Setting tab
    # Framework Gap: Requires an avails-history fixture that applies "<APPLIED>" deals to the "<SECTION>" section with "<FLAGGED>" of them having no avails for yesterday or the past 7 days
    And User applies "<APPLIED>" deals to the "<SECTION>" section of which "<FLAGGED>" have no recent avails
    # Framework Gap: Requires a no-avails warning label locator for the Deals and Deal Group sections in LifeSteps.java
    Then Verify the "<SECTION>" section shows the warning "<WARNING>"
    # Framework Gap: Requires an orange box warning locator on the Tactic Settings tab in LifeSteps.java
    And Verify the orange box warning is not displayed
    Examples:
      | SECTION    | APPLIED | FLAGGED | WARNING                  |
      | Deals      | 3       | 1       | 1 Deal(s) With No Avails |
      | Deals      | 3       | 2       | 2 Deal(s) With No Avails |
      | Deal Group | 4       | 1       | 1 Deal(s) With No Avails |
      | Deal Group | 4       | 3       | 3 Deal(s) With No Avails |

  Scenario: The orange box warning states how many deals have no estimated avails when every applied deal is unavailable
    When User clicks Tactic Setting tab
    Then User should navigate to respective Tactic Setting tab
    # Framework Gap: Requires an avails-history fixture where all 3 applied deals have no avails for yesterday or the past 7 days
    And User applies "3" deals to the "Deals" section of which "3" have no recent avails
    # Framework Gap: Requires an orange box warning locator on the Tactic Settings tab in LifeSteps.java
    Then Verify the orange box warning is displayed above the applied deals
    And Verify the orange box warning reads "3 deals have no estimated avails for yesterday or the past 7 days"

  # Source: ET-25054
  @todo
  Scenario: The no-avails warning is shown alongside the existing Different Advertisers warning
    When User clicks Tactic Setting tab
    Then User should navigate to respective Tactic Setting tab
    # Framework Gap: Requires a fixture applying 2 deals linked to different advertisers, 1 of which has no recent avails
    And User applies "2" deals linked to different advertisers to the "Deals" section of which "1" have no recent avails
    # Framework Gap: Requires a warning label locator for the Deals section in LifeSteps.java
    Then Verify the "Deals" section shows the warning "Different Advertisers"
    And Verify the "Deals" section shows the warning "1 Deal(s) With No Avails"
    And Verify the "Deals" section does not show the warning "Deals linked to different advertisers"
