  Scenario Outline: Verify additional metrics, date range, sorting, filtering and CSV export in Deal Groups Associated Tactics
    # Framework Gap: Requires step definitions for Deal Groups > Associated Tactics metrics in LifeSteps.java
    When User opens a Deal Group and navigates to the Associated Tactics view with permission "<PERMISSION>"
    Then The new metric columns visibility is "<COLUMNS>" and the date range selector visibility is "<DATE_RANGE>"
    And Selecting the date range "<RANGE>" updates the metric values and sorting a metric column reorders the tactics with a visible sort indicator
    And Filtering by a metric value shows only matching tactics and CSV export downloads a file matching the visible columns and rows
    And The "Show Tactics From Other Accounts" checkbox is not present anywhere in the view
    And All deal-group-targeted tactics populate and an empty deal group shows an empty state with the metric columns still displayed
    # Regression anchor: HT-5521 - deal ID counts were previously inflated (16 deals reported as 174)
    And Metric values match the actual deal group composition of "<DEAL_COUNT>" and are not inflated
    # Regression anchor: HT-6125 - users were previously unable to access Deal Groups in the Tactic UI
    And A user with the deal groups permission can access Deal Groups from the Tactic UI with no access error
    And The view does not expose tactic data from accounts the Internal Beta user should not access
    Examples:
      | PERMISSION | COLUMNS | DATE_RANGE | RANGE        | DEAL_COUNT |
      | full       | visible | visible    | Last 30 Days | 16         |
      | none       | hidden  | hidden     | default      | 16         |

  Scenario Outline: Verify the Deal Incompatibility warning is removed when a PG deal is added to a non-PG tactic
    # Framework Gap: Requires step definitions for PG deal incompatibility handling in LifeSteps.java
    When User with the "PG Workaround" permission adds a PG deal to a non-PG tactic
    Then No Deal Incompatibility warning, modal, toast, inline message or hover tooltip is shown
    And Adding a non-PG deal to a non-PG tactic and a PG deal to a PG tactic both proceed silently as baseline
    And The behaviour for a user without the PG Workaround permission is confirmed and documented
    And Saving and reloading the tactic shows the PG deal with no residual or stale warning state
    And Genuine incompatibility warnings for other unrelated scenarios still appear
    # Regression anchor: HT-5051 / HT-3601 - PG deal pricing display and Deal Fee plus Platform Fee double-charge
    And The PG deal shows correct "<PRICING>" pricing, incurs only the Deal Fee with no Platform Fee double-charge, and still bids and delivers
    Examples:
      | PRICING |
      | Fixed   |
      | Floor   |

  @todo
  Scenario Outline: Verify hidden deal handling and duplicate name validation in Deal Groups
    # Framework Gap: Requires step definitions for hidden deal filtering in the Deal Group Add Deals picker in LifeSteps.java
    When User opens the Deal Group Add Deals picker with at least one hidden deal in the account
    Then Hidden deals are not shown in the picker while non-hidden deals still appear correctly
    And A hidden deal already in a deal group stays active for tactics targeting that group and continues to spend
    And A deal group containing hidden deals shows clear user messaging and a group where all deals are hidden explains the state
    And Creating a deal group with the existing name "<DUP_NAME>" shows the specific duplicate-name error and the same name is allowed across different accounts
    And Re-unhiding a deal makes it reappear in the picker
    # Regression anchor: HT-5167 - Deal Groups filter previously returned 'no deals available'
    And The Add Deals filter returns the correct deals for a valid account and does not show "no deals available"
    # Regression anchor: HT-6125 - Deal Groups access in the Tactic UI
    And The applied deals count stays accurate with hidden deals counted and Deal Groups remains accessible in the Tactic UI
    Examples:
      | DUP_NAME   |
      | Test Group |
