Feature: LIFE regression - Create NPI List of following types:
  1. Static NPI List by specifying NPI Numbers
  2. Static NPI List by uploading file with NPI Numbers
  3. Smart NPI List by specifying Type
  4. Attribute NPI List
  5. Auto Import List creation

  Background:
    Given This scenario will be executed in the "Demo" environment as a "User"
    And "Life" application is logged in successfully with Account "automation@pulsepoint"
