# qa-automation

## Overview

This project / repository contains automation code for LIFE, HCP365 & STUDIO applications. Regression & Functional
testing scenario's written using business language for better understanding. Project has modular approach, it uses
features, step definitions, page classes & common functions etc.

## Technology

#### Playwright

#### JAVA

#### Cucumber

#### Maven

## Getting started

1. Clone repository as maven project, ensure all dependencies are resolved correctly. (**Note** - JDK version must be
   set in project properties)
2. Update TestRunner file with feature name / tag values as required to execute scenario's.
3. Create run configuration as shown below & execute.

## Code Style (Checkstyle)

This repo runs [Checkstyle](https://checkstyle.org) with a deliberately lightweight ruleset
(`config/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml`) suited to an automation framework rather than a strict
production-app style guide. It checks:

- Line length (max 120 chars)
- No wildcard imports, no unused imports
- No 2+ consecutive blank lines, no trailing whitespace
- camelCase for methods, parameters, local variables & fields (fields may also be
  `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`, since that's the existing convention for locator constants)

Only `src/main/java` is checked - tests, resources, and everything outside `src/` are out of
scope.

### When it runs

- `mvn verify` runs Checkstyle as part of the build.
- Every `git commit` runs it via the `.githooks/pre-commit` hook and cancels the commit on
  failure.

### Enabling the pre-commit hook

Hooks live in `.githooks/` (not `.git/hooks/`) so they're versioned with the repo, but
`core.hooksPath` itself is a local git setting - each clone needs to opt in once:

```
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

### Running it manually

```
mvn checkstyle:check
```

### Pre-existing violations

Violations that existed before Checkstyle was introduced are grandfathered in via
`config/checkstyle/suppressions.xml`, so turning this on didn't break the build for legacy
code. New or modified code is fully enforced. As a suppressed file gets cleaned up, remove its
entry from `suppressions.xml` to enforce it again; deleting the whole file lifts every
suppression at once.

## Feature File Formatting (gherkin-utils)

`.feature` files are checked for consistent Gherkin formatting (indentation, table column
alignment, blank lines) using [`@cucumber/gherkin-utils`](https://github.com/cucumber/gherkin-utils),
Cucumber's own formatter. A project wrapper removes the formatter's blank line between the last
step of a Scenario Outline and its `Examples` block. It only normalizes style - it doesn't check
step wording, tags, or scenario semantics.

### Setup

Requires Node/npm. Install the tooling once per clone:

```
npm install
```

### When it runs

Every `git commit` runs it via `.githooks/pre-commit`, but only against the `.feature` files
you've actually staged - untouched files aren't checked until you edit them. Pull requests to
`main` run the `Feature format check` GitHub Actions job against the full feature suite. Configure
that job as a required status check in the `main` branch protection rule to block unformatted PRs.

### Running it manually

```
npm run feature:check          # reports files that don't match project formatting
npm run feature:format         # reformats files in place
npm run feature:formatter:test # tests the project-specific formatting rule
```
